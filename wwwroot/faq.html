Where is the NationalMap User Manual?
</summary>
There isn't one! All user interface features of NationalMap are either obvious from the interface or are described in this Help.</p>
<p>NationalMap has been carefully designed to be as easy to use as possible. Our user experience design team run regular usability testing sessions, the results of which are then assessed for inclusion in releases.

<summary>
What browsers work with NationalMap?
</summary>
It is best to use a browser with WebGL support such as the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer 11. It will also work in some older browsers (for example IE9 and IE10) but the map rendering will be limited. It may not support 3D rendering of maps, so the 3D Terrain option may show the same result as 3D Smooth.

<summary>
What types are spatial data are displayed by NationalMap??

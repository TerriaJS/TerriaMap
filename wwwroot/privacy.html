<h2 id="privacy-1">Privacy</h2>
<p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is covered by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘the Privacy Act’). The Privacy Act contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (‘the APPs’) which governs how Australian Government agencies should collect, use, store and disclose personal information, and how individuals can access records containing their personal information. General information about the Privacy Act and the APPs can be found on the website of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-news">Office of the Australian Information Commissioner</a>.</p>

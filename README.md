[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/TerriaJS/TerriaMap.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Forked development from TerriaJS/TerriaMap for a new boilerplate cms framework based on TerriaJS with backend functionality for managing modules such as TerriaJS Catalog and other data as well as addon/plugin system for extensibility. The framework is based on an initiative to provide government agencies, research institution and space operations the capability to manage and visualize their data on a powerful, polyglotic and scalable geospatial computing framework.

This is a complete website built using the TerriaJS library. See the [TerriaJS README](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaJS) for information about TerriaJS, and getting started using this repository.

## Repository Status

Currrently under rough development. The repository is being refactored and merge with terriajs-server to develop a full-stack framework using TerriaJS modules with module management.

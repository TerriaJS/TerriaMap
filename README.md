National Map
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/nationalmap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NICTA/nationalmap)

The [National Map](http://nationalmap.gov.au) is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data from government agencies. It is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/) and the software has been developed by [Data61](http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/D61) (formerly NICTA) working closely with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au/) and other government agencies.

The National Map is designed to:
* Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and public
* Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
* Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation

NationalMap is powered by [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaJS), a free, open source geospatial catalog viewer. The content is maintained in [NationalMap-Catalog](https://github.com/TerriaJS/NationalMap-Catalog).

### Want to make your own Terria Map? ###
Please don't clone **this** repo. Instead, start your map from https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap, which is maintained as a starting point for third-party maps, without the NationalMap branding.

See the [http://terria.io/Documentation/](TerriaMap documentation) for more detailed information about Terria and how to build and run it.

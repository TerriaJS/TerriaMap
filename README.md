### We just reformatted our codebase with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (2022-08-29)

This may cause large merge conflicts when you merge `main` into your fork. See https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/discussions/6517 for instructions on how to merge this formatting change.

### We have released TerriaJS v8 (2021-08-13)

What this means:

- [Our new main branch of TerriaMap](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap/tree/main) now uses v8+ of TerriaJS
- [The terriajs7 branch of TerriaMap](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap/tree/terriajs7) will use v7 TerriaJS, but will not receive further updates
- We have a [migration guide](https://docs.terria.io/guide/contributing/migration-guide/) available for users of TerriaJS v7 to help them upgrade their applications to TerriaJS v8
- Please chat to us and the community in our [GitHub discussions forum](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/discussions)

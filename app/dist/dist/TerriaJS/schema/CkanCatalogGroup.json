The latter\rformat is easier to work with.\r  To get all the datasets with wms resources: [{ fq: 'res_format%3awms' }]\r  To get all wms/WMS datasets in the Surface Water group: [{q: 'groups=Surface Water', fq: 'res_format:WMS' }]\r  To get both wms and esri-mapService datasets: [{q: 'res_format:WMS'}, {q: 'res_format:\"Esri REST\"' }]\r  To get all datasets with no filter, you can use ['']\rThis property is required."

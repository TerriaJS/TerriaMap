In the water, it indicates the presence of microscopic green algae (phytoplankton). While these plants are a natural part of the reef ecosystem, elevated numbers (a bloom) of phytoplankton signal elevated nutrient levels, especially nitrogen, in the water. Typical sources are runoff from excess fertiliser being applied to crops and, to a lesser extent in the Great Barrier Reef region, sewage contamination from urban areas.",

      <h1>Privacy</h1>

      <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is covered by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (‘the Privacy Act’). The Privacy Act contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (‘the APPs’) which governs how Australian Government agencies should collect, use, store and disclose personal information, and how individuals can access records containing their personal information. General information about the Privacy Act and the APPs can be found on the website of the <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-news">Office of the Australian Information Commissioner</a>.</p>

      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/accountability-and-reporting/pmc-privacy-practices/privacy-policy">Our Privacy Policy can be accessed via this link</a>. The NationalMap website (this website) complies with the Australian Information Commissioner’s APP Guidelines and with our APP Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p>You are reminded that there are risks involved in sending information over the internet.</p>

      <p>Any data collected by us as described in this notice is stored securely, and archived for a period of at least five years, and possible up to ten years.</p>

      <h2>Use and disclosure</h2>

      <p>We only use personal information that we collect through this website for the purposes for which it was given to us or for related purposes, such as the maintenance, upgrade or improvements of this website or any policy development associated with this website. </p>

      <p>We do not share personal information about any individual which we collect through this website to any third party, such as other Australian Government agencies or organisations unless one of the following applies:</p>

      <p>• the individual has consented;</p>

      <p>• the individual would reasonably expect, or has been told that information of that kind is usually passed to those other individuals, agencies, organisations;</p>

      <p>• is required or authorised by law;</p>

      <p>• a Permitted General Situation (as defined under section 16A of the Privacy Act) exists (for example, it will prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to somebody’s life or health); or</p>

      <p>• the disclosure is reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the criminal law or of a law imposing a pecuniary penalty, or for the protection of public revenue.</p>

            <p>In order to give you a better experience, we use a URL shortening service provided by a third party. That service may also track the clicks and referrers (sharers) of the NationalMap.</p>
